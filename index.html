    <h1>Porfolio for Jefferson Ostler</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>My name is Jefferson Ostler. I am from Washington State. I am studying at BYU. I love desgining and building and cooking. I love running and exercising. I love college sports</p>
    <p>I never planned on being a computer nerd. But here I am, and I love it. When I started college, my sister-in-law told me to try out Information Systems. Immediately I fell in love.
      Building is my gig. Creativity is my thing.
      I am fifth of seven kids and recently married the love of my life. Her name is Amber. She is also perusing a Master's degree in Information Systems with me at BYU.
      I am thrilled about life.</p>
